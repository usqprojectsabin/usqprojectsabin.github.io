				      	Returning home from night duty as a crime-reporter, Jimmy Gowrie found the body of ex-gangster Don Shaun propped up in a nest of pillows. In the crumpled bedclothes lay a litter of little brown beads; some half-burned documents were scattered nearby, and about the dead man's neck hung the frayed ends of a rosary cord. Police investigation was entrusted to the competent but unimaginative Detective-Inspector Danvers. Jimmy knew that the detective would have little sympathy for the intuition which he himself preferred to cold facts. The first among Jimmy's intuitions was the certainty that the solving of this mystery was a personal issue between himself and the killer. He sailed right in as a good newspaperman should, and the story of his adventures is told with high speed and tough action.
